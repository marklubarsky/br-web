description: How Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement helps Children with Special Needs or Typically-developing kids
banner:
    intro: While people of all ages benefit from NeuroMovement&reg;, this work has shown great outcomes with children with various movement, motor, neurological, and socio-emotional conditions (whether diagnosed or undiagnosed).

details:
    - When our children grow, they do it through learning — learning every minute, with every action, non-stop. No matter what health conditions, talents, and hereditary predispositions the child may possess, the childhood experience and trajectory of life may be determined by how and when the learning happens. The learning occurs through experience - through moving, feeling, figuring things out, connecting with the internal and external world. Our focus is on this learning process, helping the child overcome limitations, become more resilient, and achieve true potential.
    - Children diagnosed with various developmental, learning, or neurological disorders can utilize the brain's enormous capacity to reorganize and form new habits, often leading to recovery and acquiring new skills and abilities. These outcomes helped propel Anat Baniel's and NeuroMovement's popularity among parents with children with special needs and adults recovering from neurological and developmental disorders.
