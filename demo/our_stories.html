                    <p>
                        Mark’s lifelong passion is helping clients who are dealing with problems related to modern
                        lifestyle and associated injuries and challenges. He's been an active software engineer working
                        for various "hot" tech companies in Silicon Valley for over 20 years. During his childhood, Mark
                        has been a competitive international draughts (aka checkers) player in the former USSR,
                        practicing in a sitting position for hours and hours each day. As a result of his profoundly
                        sedentary lifestyle as well as premature birth and related illnesses, he ended up suffering from
                        many aches, pains, struggles and limitations for years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After discovering the ABM NeuroMovement method, he was able to get rid of aches and pains that
                        lingered from his early childhood and learned to become a higher functioning person. He was
                        inspired to help others overcome limitations and achieve self-realization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mark completed the ABM NeuroMovement training in 2019, re-joined Olga in their practice and
                        continues to study with Anat Baniel to achieve a higher level of mastery in working with
                        Children with Special Needs and High Performers.

                    <p>
                        Olga was raised in the family of a well-respected orthopedic doctor. She observed her
                        grandmother saving injured patients on a daily basis. Olga grew passionate about helping those
                        in pain, which brought her to this profession. Olga has been practicing the ABM NeuroMovement
                        since 2009 and has completed all Mastery Programs:

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Olga is working with children and adults looking for natural and gentle ways to overcome pain
                        and limitations, achieve higher levels of skill in sports, dance, arts, personal and
                        professional lives. Please check out Olga's studio's website (where she also teaches Pilates)

                </div>
                <p class="active">... I had such good results that I brought my 85-year-old mother after she had two
                    back surgeries. She, like me, now thinks of back pain as an unusual occurrence! - Margaret L.</p>
                <p>... I felt slight improvement after a couple of sessions, and a significant improvement after a few
                    weeks. I felt not just a reduction in pain but also a tangible difference in the way my arms, hips
                    and legs all felt in my walking and my daily movements. – Peter Bartok</p>
                <p>... Within a few months I was able to again lift my own luggage (had not been able to do so for
                    several years w/o having pain later). I continue to see Olga today and am a believer in what ABM can
                    do for people who suffer from debilitating lower back pain. - Tina S.</p>
                <p>... We started ABM lessons for our daughter last summer and were happy to get the chance to get her
                    more ABM lessons. Olga approached Jewel with such gentleness, integrity, and sweetness which made
                    Jewel trust her right away. She allowed Olga to work on her, and her body slowly transformed,
                    getting softer and opening up, as if moving forward. Going from tightness to openness, from
                    congestion to open airways. - Ivana.</p>
                <p>...the pains have really disappeared. I was able to run my first half marathon. I started playing
                    volleyball again. I no longer stretch, or even feel the need to stretch. I’m now 8 months pregnant
                    and attribute my lack of the typical aches and pains that most pregnant women complain of to the
                    fact that I still have weekly lessons with Olga. - Kristen A.</p>
                <p>... I highly recommend working with Mark and Olga to overcome physical limitations and injuries and
                    gain new body awareness." – Noelle Wood</p>
