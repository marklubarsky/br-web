<p class="show">... I had such good results that I brought my 85-year-old mother after she had two back surgeries. She, like me, now thinks of back pain as an unusual occurrence! - Margaret L.</p>
<p>... I felt slight improvement after a couple of sessions, and a significant improvement after a few weeks. I felt not just a reduction in pain but also a tangible difference in the way my arms, hips and legs all felt in my walking and my daily movements. – Peter Bartok</p>
<p>... Within a few months I was able to again lift my own luggage (had not been able to do so for several years w/o having pain later). I continue to see Olga today and am a believer in what ABM can do for people who suffer from debilitating lower back pain. - Tina S.</p>
<p>... We started ABM lessons for our daughter last summer and were happy to get the chance to get her more ABM lessons. Olga approached Jewel with such gentleness, integrity, and sweetness which made Jewel trust her right away. She allowed Olga to work on her, and her body slowly transformed, getting softer and opening up, as if moving forward. Going from tightness to openness, from congestion to open airways. - Ivana.</p>
<p>...the pains have really disappeared. I was able to run my first half marathon. I started playing volleyball again. I no longer stretch, or even feel the need to stretch. I’m now 8 months pregnant and attribute my lack of the typical aches and pains that most pregnant women complain of to the fact that I still have weekly lessons with Olga. - Kristen A.</p>
<p>... I highly recommend working with Mark and Olga to overcome physical limitations and injuries and gain new body awareness." – Noelle Wood</p>
