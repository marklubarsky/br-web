<!--title: Mark Lubarsky-->
<!--text:-->
<!-- - Mark’s lifelong passion is helping clients who are dealing with problems related to modern lifestyle and associated injuries and challenges. He's been a very active software engineer working for various "hot" tech companies in Silicon Valley for over 20 years. During his childhood, Mark has been a competitive international draughts (aka checkers) player in the former USSR, practicing in a sitting position for hours and hours each day. As a result of his profoundly sedentary lifestyle as well as premature birth and related illnesses, he ended up suffering from many aches, pains, struggles and limitations for years.-->
<!-- - After discovering the ABM NeuroMovement method, he was able to get rid of aches and pains that lingered from his early childhood and learned to become a higher functioning person. He was inspired to help others overcome limitations and achieve self-realization.-->
<!-- - Mark completed the ABM NeuroMovement training in 2019, re-joined Olga in their practice and continues to study with Anat Baniel to achieve a higher level of mastery in working with Children with Special Needs and High Performers.-->
