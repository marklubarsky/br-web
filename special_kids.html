intro: While both Kids and Adults benefit greatly from NeuroMovement, this work has shown very promising outcomes with children.
details:
    - Children grow through learning — learning every minute, with every action, non-stop. No matter what health conditions, talents, and hereditary predispositions on the other, the childhood experience and trajectory of life may be determined by how and when the learning happens.  The learning occurs through experience - through moving, feeling, figuring things out, connecting with the internal and external world.  Our focus is on this learning process, helping the child overcome limitations and achieve true potential.
    - Children diagnosed with various developmental, learning, or neurological disorders can utilize the brain's enormous capacity to reorganize and form new habits, often leading to the recovery of function and acquiring new skills and abilities. These outcomes helped propel Anat Baniel's and NeuroMovement’s popularity among parents with children with special needs and adults recovering from neurological and developmental disorders.
