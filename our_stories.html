                                <p>My lifelong passion is helping people dealing with problems related to modern lifestyle and associated injuries and limitations. I've been an active software engineer working for various "hot" tech companies in Silicon Valley for over 20 years. During my childhood, I've been a competitive national draughts/checkers player in the former USSR. I remember practicing in a sitting position for hours and hours each day. As a result of my profoundly sedentary lifestyle as well as premature birth and related illnesses, I ended up suffering from many aches, pains, struggles and limitations for years. My introduction to the Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement (based on Feldenkrais) has changed my life and opened the world of new possibilities. It gave me a sense of higher purpose that I can now fulfill by helping others. I ended up taking the ABM Neuromovement training twice, completed over 1000 hours of training directly from Anat Baniel throughout ten years, and will graduate in February 2019. After that, I will be continuing my Mastery training with Children with Special Needs, Vitality and High-Performers in 2019-2021. From my personal experience, with the help of ABM NeuroMovement Method, I got rid of chronic headaches that I've suffered since my teenage years. Also, my constant neck, back and shoulder blade discomfort that I thought would never go away is completely gone. Beyond my physical benefits from my NeuroMovement journey, I have two significant takeaways from the process and what I'm committed to helping my clients with: "Learn to accomplish more with less effort" and "gain clearer thinking through easier movements." These skills are precious in today's world, especially for those of us who push through our lives, here, in the SF Bay Area.</p>

                                <p>Olga and I have started to study directly with Anat Baniel back in 2009. Since then Olga has expanded her Pilates studio to teach ABM NeuroMovement along with Pilates. Olga has recently completed a Mastery training for Vitality and Anti-Aging. She also continues to study with Anat Baniel and will start her Mastery training in NeuroMovement for High-Performers in 2019.

                                        <p class="show">... I had such good results that I brought my 85-year-old mother after she had two back surgeries. She, like me, now thinks of back pain as an unusual occurrence!" - Margaret L.</p>
                                        <p>... I felt slight improvement after a couple of sessions, and a significant improvement after a few weeks. I felt not just a reduction in pain but also a tangible difference in the way my arms, hips and legs all felt in my walking and my daily movements. – Peter Bartok</p>
                                        <p>... Within a few months I was able to again lift my own luggage (had not been able to do so for several years w/o having pain later). I continue to see Olga today and am a believer in what ABM can do for people who suffer from debilitating lower back pain." - Tina S.</p>
                                        <p>... We started ABM lessons for our daughter last summer and were happy to get the chance to get her more ABM lessons. Olga approached Jewel with such gentleness, integrity, and sweetness which made Jewel trust her right away. She allowed Olga to work on her, and her body slowly transformed, getting softer and opening up, as if moving forward. Going from tightness to openness, from congestion to open airways. - Ivana.</p>
                                        <p>...the pains have really disappeared. I was able to run my first half marathon. I started playing volleyball again. I no longer stretch, or even feel the need to stretch. I’m now 8 months pregnant and attribute my lack of the typical aches and pains that most pregnant women complain of to the fact that I still have weekly lessons with Olga. - Kristen A.</p>
                                        <p>... I highly recommend working with Mark and Olga to overcome physical limitations and injuries and gain new body awareness." – Noelle Wood</p>
