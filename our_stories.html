                                <p>My lifelong passion is helping people dealing with problems related to modern lifestyle and associated injuries and limitations. I've been an active software engineer working for various "hot" tech companies in Silicon Valley for over 20 years. During my childhood, I've been a competitive national draughts/checkers player in the former USSR. I remember practicing in a sitting position for hours and hours each day. As a result of my profoundly sedentary lifestyle as well as premature birth and related illnesses, I ended up suffering from many aches, pains, struggles and limitations for years. My introduction to the Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement (based on Feldenkrais) has changed my life and opened the world of new possibilities. It gave me a sense of higher purpose that I can now fulfill by helping others. I ended up taking the ABM Neuromovement training twice, completed over 1000 hours of training directly from Anat Baniel throughout ten years, and will graduate in February 2019. After that, I will be continuing my Mastery training with Children with Special Needs, Vitality and High-Performers in 2019-2021. From my personal experience, with the help of ABM NeuroMovement Method, I got rid of chronic headaches that I've suffered since my teenage years. Also, my constant neck, back and shoulder blade discomfort that I thought would never go away is completely gone. Beyond my physical benefits from my NeuroMovement journey, I have two significant takeaways from the process and what I'm committed to helping my clients with: "Learn to accomplish more with less effort" and "gain clearer thinking through easier movements." These skills are precious in today's world, especially for those of us who push through our lives, here, in the SF Bay Area.</p>

                                <p>Olga and I have started to study directly with Anat Baniel back in 2009. Since then Olga has expanded her Pilates studio to teach ABM NeuroMovement along with Pilates. Olga has recently completed a Mastery training for Vitality and Anti-Aging. She also continues to study with Anat Baniel and will start her Mastery training in NeuroMovement for High-Performers in 2019.
