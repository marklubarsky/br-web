    explanation:
        title: Explanation
        text:
            - We view the nature of the brain and body as the whole human system. We believe that most often, pain comes from the way we have been using our bodies, like standing, sitting, walking, and perform other everyday movements. At the same time, it's also about our perception of what it takes to move, how to apply the effort when something does not work, and what being "ourselves" really means.
            - The quality of how we learn to move and adapt to changes greatly affects our physical, cognitive, and emotional state. It helps us go through life's stresses, recover from injuries, achieve a higher state of well-being. It give us a higher level of energy, freedom, and creativity. Overall, the more organized movement and thinking patterns help us become more resilient and realize our true potential.
            - While the original cause of the pain may be an injury or another medical condition, when our ability to move naturally and efficiently is compromised, it affects our ability to self-heal. Many small problems turn into chronic diseases as a result of poor habitual movement patterns.
            - As we relearn healthier movement patterns, we get better. "Getting better" may carry a very different meaning for different people. For some, it may be a "miracle of healing," while others discover new exciting effects that they would have never thought would occur.
            - Everyone's experience is their own, and we do not make any "miracle" promises. While many clients call the effects of this work "miracles," we only work together with you to help you recover lost abilities by accessing the brain's power to form new patterns.
            - While the "visible" focus is on neuro-muscular conditioning and chronic pain relief, these newly acquired skills are ready to be integrated into any daily activity.

    science:
        title: Science
        text:
            - The scientists are now making progress in their research of the relationship between brain and movement, mind and body, and the whole concept that the two are not separated. All of our pain and limitations, whether they stem from physical injuries/conditions, emotional stress, poor habits, self-limiting thinking patterns, are interconnected. We help you start this process of overcoming your limitations by helping you learn how to use less effort and to achieve more outcome naturally.
