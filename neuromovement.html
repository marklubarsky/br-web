                            <p>Imagine lying down on a padded table. You are feeling comfortable with all props and adjustments that the experienced practitioner made specifically for you through careful observation. Then the practitioner is starting to move you very gently in various ways, listening to how your body (or rather you, as a whole) respond, how easy and natural your movement patterns are. You are feeling the connection with the practitioner, and together you discover new ways of movement — new or old and forgotten ways of action. You’re noticing no discomfort, no effort, greater freedom and a sense of overall lightness and well-being.</p>

                        <h2>Our Promise</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Everyone's experience is their own, and we do not make any "miracle" promises. However, many clients call the effects of this work "miracles." What we believe is that you are a miracle, your brain is a miracle. We only work together with you to help you recover the lost magic.</p>
                    <p>These "magic" powers are what we all already possess, but over the years of use, we either lose them or hide them so deep that some of us never recover. The scientists are now making progress in their research of the relationship between brain and movement, mind and body, and the whole concept that the two are not separated. All of our pain and limitations, whether they stem from physical injuries/conditions, emotional stress, poor habits, self-limiting thinking patterns, are interconnected. We help you start this process of overcoming your limitations by helping you re-train your movement patterns, so you learn how to use less effort to achieve more outcome naturally. While the "visible" focus is on neuro-muscular conditioning and chronic pain relief, these newly acquired skills are ready to be integrated into any daily activity.</p>
                    <p>So we promise that we will be there for you, using our very comprehensive training from the best practitioners in the world. We will dedicate our energy in applying the proven power of the NeuroMovement Method to help you.</p>

                            <p>The reason why NeuroMovement has helped so many people with chronic conditions is the nature of the brain and the human system as a whole. We believe that most often pain comes from the way we have been using our body, like standing, sitting, walking, and other everyday movements. While the original cause of the pain may be an injury or another medical condition, when our ability to move naturally and efficiently is compromised, it affects our ability to self-heal. Many small problems turn into chronic diseases as a result of poor habitual movement patterns. As we relearn healthier movement patterns, we get better. "Getting better" may carry a very different meaning for different people. For some, it may be a "miracle of healing," while others discover new exciting effects that they would have never thought would occur.</p>
